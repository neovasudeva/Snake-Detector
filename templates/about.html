  <p>
    Snake.ai relies on FAIR's Detectron2 and uses the state-of-the-art Mask R-CNN architecture to create masks
    and bounding boxes around the snakes. The model was trained and deployed as a simple Flask application, 
    using Bootstrap to make UI development quick and simple. The project was created and is currently maintained
    by Neo Vasudeva (me). To see the source code, look at the 
    <a href="https://github.com/neovasudeva/Snake-Detector">Github</a> repo. If you like what you see, please

  <p>
    For the future, I plan to use the model for real-time detection of snakes around the house. While snakes 
    are not a big issue in the Northern and Western parts of the US, the Southeast has snakes hiding 
    around every corner in the spring and summer.

  <p>
    This model is brand new, which means that it's pretty bad (despite my best efforts) at singling 
    out snakes from images. Some currently known issues:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The model has trouble identifying entangled snakes, singling out snakes while they eat something, 
      and intertwined snakes, and snakes facing towards the camera.
    </li>
    <li>
      The model has trouble identifying snakes in blurry images. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Multiple detections of snakes when presented an image of only one snake. I believe this issue
      arose as a result of minimal training data (but I'm not an expert so if I'm wrong, tell me).
    </li>
    <li>
      The model takes a while to identify snakes. This problem can be solved easily by running inference 
      using GPUs. As of now, it runs using the CPU (because I don't have a GPU on me while developing).
    </li> 
  </ul>

  <h1 class="text-center">Future Releases</h1>
  <h5 class="text-center">Current Version: 1.0</h5>

  <p>
    Every release will be aimed at reducing the time to get an identification of snakes and of course
    solve the pressing issues mentioned above. I'll also maintain and update the current version 
    running just for kicks. Some features I'm thinking about implementing: 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Persisting submitted images to a database for further training (with the permission of the 
      user of course).
    </li>
    <li> 
      Adding identificiation of humans and pets. This is more applicable for real-time detection around a house
      to warn the user that a snake is in close proximity to a person or domesticated animal.
    </li>
  </ul>
